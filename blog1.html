        <p class="blogOne">
            This is by far the most important article you will ever read before you start a blog. The knowledge of blog
            niche will define your future success or lack of this knowledge, might lead to failure.

            There are countless people who started a blog and had quit it before they could have discovered the glory
            they were destined to.

            What I found most interesting here is, the majority of them echoed the same voice:
            <li class="blogOne"> I quit because I couldn’t drive blog traffic</li>
            <li class="blogOne"> quit because I could not make money</li>
            <li class="blogOne">I was unsuccessful</li>
            <li class="blogOne">I was not lucky </li>
            For me, it is disheartening to hear this, as I know the issue is not the hard work of these quitters, but lack of understanding of profitable blogging, and especially zero understanding of blog niche. 
            <h2 >The biggest mistake in niche selection?</h2>
            <p class="blogOne">There are a few mistakes that a lot of beginners make when it comes to niche selection. Let me pen down a few of them.</p>
            <h3>1. Getting into a generic niche:</h3>
            <p class="blogOne">A generic niche is a broad niche, which is usually high competition, and very broad. For example Health niche, tech niche, Fashion niche. 
                A better way to look into it is, by focusing on a specialized narrow niche within a broad niche.
                
                This alone would ensure your blog becomes a success in terms of popularity, traffic, and money.
                
                Moreover, you become a specialized expert, since you would be spending a lot of time researching, learning, and writing around one focused topic.</p>

                <h3>2. Fewer monetization options:</h3>
            <p class="blogOne">A lot of beginners get into blogging by focusing only on AdSense. This is mostly due to lack of information, and this should not be the only criteria of profitable niche selection.

                You need to widen your horizon and focus on a niche that provides an option for more monetization opportunities.</p>

                <h3>3. Without Research, Failure Happens:</h3>
            <p class="blogOne">If your goal is to make a sustainable business (income stream) from your blogging effort, you need to spend time researching and using data to pick a niche.

                This may require 2-3 days before you could start your blog. But, this exercise alone would help you validate your idea, and your decision is not solely based on passion and gut feelings. 
                
                On the contrary, gut feeling is not a bad thing, as long as you are well nurtured with the right information, prior to launching your blog.</p>

                <h3>4. Sticking To A Wrong Niche:</h3>
                <p class="blogOne">“It is ok, I will make it a success”, such kind of thought often lead to frustration in the near future, and ultimately would let you quit working on your blog.

                    Often when you realise you are working in the wrong niche, you have an option to start a new website (in a new niche), and then make it work for you. In fact, your second blog might be a success, as you will be utilising your knowledge from the old blog, into a new one. 
                    
                    In my 12 years of career as a blogger, every new blog has become a faster success than the earlier one. So do not be afraid of leaving your old niche, and starting a new one when you realise the old niche is too saturated, or you have no interest in it anymore.</p>
