            Searching for the best WordPress Amazon affiliate plugins?

            Amazon’s popular affiliate program, Amazon Affiliates, is a great way to monetize niche sites or product review sites. Because it’s such a popular affiliate program, you can find some really useful WordPress plugins to help you insert Amazon affiliate links, keep your prices and product details updated via the Amazon Associates API, create product comparison tables, and more.

            <h3>1. AAWP (Amazon Affiliate WordPress Plugin)
            </h3>
            <p class="blogOne"> AAWP, short for Amazon Affiliate WordPress Plugin, is one of the most popular solutions for Amazon affiliates using WordPress.
                AAWP does pretty much everything you need for working with the Amazon Associates program. It can help you:


            </p>

            <h3>2. Fewer monetization options:</h3>
            <p class="blogOne">A lot of beginners get into blogging by focusing only on AdSense. This is mostly due to
                lack of information, and this should not be the only criteria of profitable niche selection.

                You need to widen your horizon and focus on a niche that provides an option for more monetization
                opportunities.</p>

            <h3>3. Without Research, Failure Happens:</h3>
            <p class="blogOne">If your goal is to make a sustainable business (income stream) from your blogging effort,
                you need to spend time researching and using data to pick a niche.

                This may require 2-3 days before you could start your blog. But, this exercise alone would help you
                validate your idea, and your decision is not solely based on passion and gut feelings.

                On the contrary, gut feeling is not a bad thing, as long as you are well nurtured with the right
                information, prior to launching your blog.</p>

            <h3>4. Sticking To A Wrong Niche:</h3>
            <p class="blogOne">“It is ok, I will make it a success”, such kind of thought often lead to frustration in
                the near future, and ultimately would let you quit working on your blog.

                Often when you realise you are working in the wrong niche, you have an option to start a new website (in
                a new niche), and then make it work for you. In fact, your second blog might be a success, as you will
                be utilising your knowledge from the old blog, into a new one.

                In my 12 years of career as a blogger, every new blog has become a faster success than the earlier one.
                So do not be afraid of leaving your old niche, and starting a new one when you realise the old niche is
                too saturated, or you have no interest in it anymore.</p>
